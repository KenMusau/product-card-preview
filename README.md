## Overview

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshots


Desktop view for screens not less than 645px

Mobile view of screen not wider than 375px

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to center containers in the middle of the page using flexbox.
I have also practiced on how to do layouts using both grid and flexbox


```css
body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```



### Continued development

I want to perfect on how to use flexbox and grid technigues the right way. I am also going to improve on creating responsive websites
